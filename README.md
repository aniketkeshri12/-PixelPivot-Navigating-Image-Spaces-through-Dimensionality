Implemented an Image Clustering Project using Python and Data Science Libraries.
 sept 2023– Nov 2023
 • Executed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch to transform a dataset comprising 1,797 8x8 pixel
 images into a lower-dimensional space, leveraging numpy for eigenvalue and eigenvector computations
 • Developed a custom clustering mechanism to categorize images based on the reduced dimensions, exploring variance
 and optimal dimensionality through variance analysis.
